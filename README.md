# Mean Shift
Here we are going to:

1. Explain the Mean Shift Model.
2. Train a Mean Shift with sklearn to create clusters.
3. Explain Mean Shift hyperparameters.
4. **Bonus track** Brief introduction to Principal Componet Analysis Algorithm

#### Please don't use this dataset to create clusters, it's only for learning purposes
